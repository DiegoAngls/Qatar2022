# List of potential PET preprocessing: 

 

## **By priority:** 

 

- Re-run the young subjects with the new PET reconstruction -> to get the positive/negative cut-off/threshold 

- Add other reference regions, such as eroded WM reference region, for both AB and TAU PET for longitudinal -> Landau et al., 2015 AB & Young et al., 2021 tau -> but we need to find/define the WM eroded mask for example 

- Get Centaurz for tau -> Villemagne presentation 2022 

- Get Centiloid for amyloid (we already have normally) -> Klunk et al., 2015 

- Add standard PVC in the pipeline (check methods in lab’s, e.g., papers Pierre’s paper, + studies in top journal, if standard method emerges or not)? 

- Re-organize the pipeline so we can implement futures modifications easier
